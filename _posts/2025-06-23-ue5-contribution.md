Recently, my pull request for Unreal Engine 5 repository got accepted. I was studying UE5's Gameplay Ability System (GAS) and saw that the comments in AttributeSet.h had some minor typos. So I made a pull request of the UE5 repository fixing the typos in the header file.

I actually created the same pull request twice because Epic Games suddenly changed their pull request standards. The changed standard requires you to confirm the checklist that your code adheres to the Epic coding standards and the change does not include source code created by Generative AI.

Although it may be a very trivial commit, I am very happy to contribute to one of the most used and famous game engines. In the future I wish to contribute more performance related complex code.
