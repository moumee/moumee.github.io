Recently, my pull request for Unreal Engine 5 repository got accepted. I was studying UE5's Gameplay Ability System (GAS) and saw that the comments in AttributeSet.h had some minor typos. So I made a pull request of the UE5 repository fixing the typos in the header file.

_UE5 repository commit history_

The pull request I made was actually kind of wrong. When I forked the UE5 repository, the default branch was set to 'release' so I accidentally created a branch from the 'release' not the 'ue5-main'. But thankfully, Epic games developers made a new commit in the ue5-main branch referencing my pull request. Next time when I make a new pull request for UE5, I should remember to create a branch from ue5-main.  

Although my pull request may be a very trivial fix, I am very happy to contribute to one of the most used and famous game engines. In the future I wish to contribute more performance related complex code.
